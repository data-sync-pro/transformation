For example, $Joiner.Parent__r.Status__c references the Status__c field on the joined record’s Parent__r relationship."

Field Mapping: If a formula evaluates to `$SKIP_ASSIGNMENT`, the target field is excluded from the request payload. Scope Filters: If a formula evaluates to `$SKIP_ASSIGNMENT`, the source record is omitted from processing.\nThis enables fine-grained control over field-level assignments and record-level processing."
