      "description": "$CONTEXT_RECORD_ID is used in UI-based rules engines—such as Data Loader, Data List, and Action Button—to dynamically reference the current record ID from the Lightning Record Page. When used in transformations, it is automatically replaced with the record’s ID at runtime."

      "description": "$Joiner is a prefix used to reference fields from a dataset that has been joined in the Scoping step of an Executable (left-join or cross-join). It allows downstream logic—such as Scope Filter (Post Join) rules and field mappings—to access the joined record’s fields. For example, $Joiner.Parent__r.Status__c references the Status__c field on the joined record’s Parent__r relationship."
